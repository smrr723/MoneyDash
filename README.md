# MoneyDash
RESTFul &amp; CRUD spending tracker Web App, built with the MVC pattern using Ruby/Sinatra, TDD and responsive CSS.

### Overview
MoneyDash was a week long Ruby project undertaken to consolidate and practice everything learned during the first 4 weeks of the [CodeClan](https://codeclan.com/) intensive Software Development course, including the following:

- Ruby fundamentals
- TDD
- OOP
- Web Programming ( REST/MVC )
- Databases with CRUD actions

### MVP
Be able to create new Transactions ( which should include a merchant name, e.g. Tesco, and a value ) which have an associated Tag (e.g. 'food', 'clothes'). Your app would then be able to track a total, and display this in a view.

As a minimum, users should be able to:

* Create new transactions
* Display a list of all transactions
* Display total amount spent
* Display total amount spent by tag
* Have CRUD actions for the transactions
